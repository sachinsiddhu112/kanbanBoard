## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This project marked my first experience using Next.js with TypeScript and ShadCN. Previously, I worked with React.js and JavaScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling. As a beginner in TypeScript, I encountered several type errors along the way, and integrating ShadCN—which I was using for the first time—added an extra layer of challenge. However, it turned out to be a great learning experience.

ShadCN is an excellent UI library that provides pre-built components with the flexibility to customize them to fit specific requirements. I was impressed by how it accelerated development and offered sleek, ready-to-use components. Moving forward, I plan to use ShadCN in future projects as it significantly enhances both development speed and the quality of the UI.

For the backend, I used Express.js in this project alongside Next.js. However, in future projects, I’d like to explore using Next.js as a full-stack framework rather than just for frontend, given its growing capabilities in handling both frontend and backend.
